\frametitle{Write efficient loops}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Avoid loops as much as possible.
  \item Use \texttt{()apply} type loop if possible.
  \item Think a lot about under- and over-flow
  \item Allocate the memory space before looping. This is a much
    slower loop.
\begin{verbatim}
B = matrix(1:10,2,5)
C = matrix(100:109,2,5)
A = NULL
for(i in 1:n)
{
  A[i] = B[i] + C[i]
}
\end{verbatim}

  \end{itemize}
